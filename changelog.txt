Version: 1.2.0
Date: 15. 12. 2024
  Features:
    - Added a setting to blacklist entity IDs so they aren't affected by the multiplier.
  Bugfixes:
    - Heat multipliers now affect pipes, belts, underground pipes/belts, splitters, and storage tanks.
    - For entities that don't need heating, this mod will no longer change their heating energy from zero to zero (to avoid spam in prototype change history).

Date: 04. 12. 2024
  Features:
    - Multipliers now affect roboports, robots, and roboport equipment. Robot range is not affected, because increased battery and faster recharge cancels out increased power consumption.
